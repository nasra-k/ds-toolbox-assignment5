# Definition: git status

This terminal command provides the status of all files in your repository plus provides hints on which
actions to take next. This ensures that you know exactly which changes you are about to commit
before committing them. It is similar to the side panel in JupyterLab
which organizes 'Untracked', 'Changed' and 'Staged' files under separate headings. Although
similar to the side panel in the IDE, 'git status' in the terminal has the added 
advantage of providing possible next action(s) depending on the status of the file.
